# SpaHE-Infil

SpaHE-Infil is a spatial analysis tool for the tumor microenvironment, enabling the reconstruction of spatial distributions of key cell types from routine HE-stained sections. It trains models using spatial transcriptomics data and constructs a multimodal predictive model by integrating nuclear-cytoplasmic morphology, texture features, and cell density from HE images. Its innovation lies in the introduction of a dynamic TME proportion calibration mechanism, capable of outputting parameter-adjustable visualization results, thus providing an effective tool for pathological diagnosis and tumor immunology research.

## Core Workflow

This pipeline consists of 4 main scripts and 2 supplementary scripts, designed to be run in sequence:

### Main Scripts
 **01.SpatialAnno_auto.R**  
   - Automated spatial domain annotation  
   - Initial cell type identification
   - This pipeline supports other annotation methods (including manual annotation) for integration into subsequent processes.

 **02.train_model-TMEadj.R**  
   - Train TME-adjusted classification model  
   - Integrate spatial context features

 **03.predict_celltypes-TMEadj.R**  
   - Predict cell types using trained model  
   - Generate spatial distribution maps

 **04.spa-HE evaluate Y-correction.R**  
   - Evaluate prediction accuracy  
   - Perform Y-correction analysis  
   - Integrate with HE staining data

### Supplementary Scripts
- **Sup.train_model-TMEadj_HE feature get.R**  
  Extract features from HE images for model training

- **Sup.train_model-TMEadj_model features.R**  
  Additional feature engineering for model optimization

## Usage Steps
1. Run spatial annotation  
   `Rscript 01.SpatialAnno_auto.R`

2. Train the model  
   `Rscript 02.train_model-TMEadj.R`
   
   Supplementary Script. Prepare features using supplementary scripts  
      `Rscript Sup.train_model-TMEadj_HE feature get.R`  
      `Rscript Sup.train_model-TMEadj_model features.R`
   
4. Predict cell types  
   `Rscript 03.predict_celltypes-TMEadj.R`

5. Evaluate and correct results  
   `Rscript 04.spa-HE evaluate Y-correction.R`

## Requirements
